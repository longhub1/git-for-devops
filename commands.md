### Basic Git Commands Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through creating a simple Git project. You’ll learn how to initialize a repository, add files, and make commits.

1. **Create a Directory**  
   Start by creating a new directory for your project and navigating into it.

   ```bash
   mkdir CommunityEvent
   cd CommunityEvent
   ```

2. **Initialize a Git Repository**  
   Set up a new Git repository in the directory.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Create a File and Add Initial Content**  
   Create a new file named `ideas.txt` and add some content.

   ```bash
   echo "Outdoor Movie Night" > ideas.txt
   ```

4. **Stage the File for Commit**  
   Add the new file to the staging area.

   ```bash
   git add ideas.txt
   ```

5. **Commit the Changes**  
   Commit the changes to the repository with a message describing the commit.

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add initial event ideas"
   ```

6. **Append More Content to the File**  
   Add another line to the existing file.

   ```bash
   echo "Potluck Dinner" >> ideas.txt
   ```

7. **View the Commit History**  
   Check the commit history to see your changes.

   ```bash
   git log
   ```

These steps cover basic Git operations such as creating a repository, adding files, making commits, and viewing the history.
